# Simulation of all-terminal reliability of an undirected network using the reliability polynomial and plotting reliability polynomial

A simulator was
developed and its results compared with the values of the
reliability polynomial. The lack of exact methods for
calculating reliability polynomials is considered and an
approximate method for calculating reliability polynomials
covering the shortcomings of exact methods is
implemented. A comparative performance analysis of the
network reliability simulation, an approximate and exact
method for determining the reliability polynomial, was
performed.
There is an option for plotting reliability polynomial with the chosen accuracy as well.
